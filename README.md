# Xray-analysis
Analysis of X-ray data

Script originally developed to run the analysis of the first extended X-ray campaign (January-March 2021): python fitVfb.py
Then it was modified to be able to manage also the annealing part, but its main purpose is still to analyse the irradiation data.

### Get the code

```
export SCRAM_ARCH="slc7_amd64_gcc900"  # for bash
cmsrel CMSSW_11_3_1
cd cmsrel CMSSW_11_3_1/src/
cmsenv
```
Set this environment variable with your github user (or set it by hand if it doesn't work). 
Currently the code is in the branch named __mciprian_devel__ from the repository of cippy
```
YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY=$(git config user.github)
git remote add cippy git@github.com:cippy/Xray-analysis.git
git clone -o cippy git@github.com:cippy/Xray-analysis.git -b mciprian_devel xRayAnalysis
cd xRayAnalysis
git remote add origin git@github.com:$YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY/Xray-analysis.git
```

### Run the code

A new version was developed during November 2021, based on __makeXrayStudy.py__
Example:
```
python3 makeXrayStudy.py -o <outputdir> -c configs_Nov2021/
```
There are options to customize some features, like samples to use, structures (e.g. if you only want to run on the GCD) and so on.
For instance:
```
python3 makeXrayStudy.py -o <outputdir> -c configs_Nov2021/ --samples "N4788-9_LR" "N4789-10_UL" --structures "MOShalf" "MOS2000"
```

More features are work in progress.
There are still some hardcoded parts to adjust plots for specific dose steps in order to get a sensible measurement. 
At some point one will need a better algorithm, although some manual customization using external configuration files may be require (to be passed using __-c__)


### Examples for older version of the code (obsolete)

Testing some options to customize output
```
python3 fitVfb.py -o /some/output/folder/on/eos/ --outfiles /local/folder/for/output/rootfiles/ --skip MOS --samples 1012_UL
```

For annealing studies, use a command like the following
```
python3 fitVfb.py -o /some/output/folder/on/eos/MOShalf/ --skip GCD --samples 1011_LR -a --annealing-path-regexp "1011_LR_ann_60min_60C_MOShalf_20C.*"
```
